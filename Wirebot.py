"""Please read this file from top to bottom.. There are places where you will need to edit this file to match YOUR Wirebot configuration.
The variables you need to set are:

    PORT, V1, V2, V3

Once you have this file all setup.  (Your vertices all set) then it will open the serial port that you specified and connect to the grblShield.  
Once this is connected  the instructions being sent to your wirebot motors are a "configuration loop".  
This means that all motors move your center object.  Ours was a ping pong ball up and down.. Forever... This is done to make sure
that your machine is behaving correctly before trying any of the other pre-defined shapes.   Once you know your machine is functioning 
correctly (moving up and down) you can comment  out the code that calls the configurationLoop() function.  You can read more about 
how to do this at the bottom of the source code. 

Lastly, should you want further explanation about how / why this code is the way it is be sure to check out the full technical write up at:
https://www.synthetos.com/blog/grblshield-wirebot/

        DOWN = - for Z
        
        We use a 2'x 2' frame for this project.  So Roughly 24/2 = 12.  But we use 11.5

        V3 = (  0,  12,  12)  #Rear Vertex
        

        The above example assumes the vertices are all at the same height, but they donât have to be. 
        Just enter the actual height from the origin (Which is 0,0,0 Or the center of the triangle). The example also assumes that the rear vertex is 
        half way between the left and right in X, but it doesnât have to be.  The positions of the vertices
        are somewhat arbitrary, assuming you donât reduce the useful working volume too much.
        
        What does that mean?  It does not have to be a perfect equilateral triangle.  Or that each vertex does not need
        to be at the same height as the others.  However each "offset" will cut into your working volume area.
